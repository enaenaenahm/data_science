As part of my training, I completed a series of projects covering the key aspects of Data Science — from working with UNIX utilities to data visualization and analysis. Below is a brief overview of each project:

### 🔹 `day_00` — Command Line and Data Processing

Learned to use UNIX tools (`curl`, `sort`, `uniq`, `jq`, `sed`, `cat`) for collecting, filtering, and preprocessing text and JSON data. Gained basic skills in automating data processing from the command line.

### 🔹 `day_01` — Python Basics

Studied Python syntax and core constructs: variables, conditional statements, loops, lists, functions, and string operations. Solved simple data processing tasks.

### 🔹 `day_02` — Object-Oriented Programming I

Got introduced to the principles of OOP: classes, attributes, methods, encapsulation. Created simple structures to model objects and their behavior.

### 🔹 `day_03` — Object-Oriented Programming II

Deepened my knowledge of OOP: inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding. Learned how to build class hierarchies and use abstractions for code reusability.

### 🔹 `day_04` — Code Optimization

Learned to analyze and improve the performance of Python code. Compared different approaches to iterations (`for`, `iterrows`, `apply`, vectorization), used profiling, and applied downcasting methods for memory optimization.

### 🔹 `day_05` — Pandas

Explored the Pandas library for tabular data analysis: filtering, aggregation, grouping, data cleaning, handling missing values, and type conversions. Practiced using `.groupby()`, `.merge()`, `.dropna()`, `.fillna()`, and other methods.

### 🔹 `day_06` — SQL + Python

Combined SQL and Pandas: connected to a database using `sqlite3`, wrote SQL queries, loaded results into a DataFrame, and performed data analysis by integrating both tools.

### 🔹 `day_07` — Data Visualization

Learned to create plots with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`: histograms, boxplots, line charts, heatmaps, and interactive visualizations. Understood how to choose the right chart type for different data and tasks.
